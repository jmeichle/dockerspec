# TODO for Dockerspec

* [ ] Log parsing contains `"\x00"` chars.
* [ ] Integrate with [Inspec](https://www.chef.io/inspec/).
* [ ] Test resources for built images supported inside `docker_compose`.
* [ ] Add `docker_context`, `docker_describe` to avoid starting all containers at the same time.
* [ ] Add a Runner logger.
* [ ] Create `stub_*` methods for unit tests.
